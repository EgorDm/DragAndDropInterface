Was quite inspired by this article. And updated the code to newer jquery version and converted the code to an es6 module.
[Here is the article.](http://blog.stackhive.com/post/137799349684/building-a-seamless-drag-and-drop-interface)

[You can check the demo right here.](https://egordm.github.io/DragAndDropInterface/)

How to run the code?

Download node packages and build it.
```
npm update
npm run dev
```

You can also use watch while editing.
```
npm run watch
```
